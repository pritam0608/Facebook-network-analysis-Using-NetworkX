This project "Facebook network analysis Using NetworkX" covers the following key aspects:

* facebook Network Analysis with NetworkX
1. Analyze and visualize network graphs.
2. Understand the structure and properties of graphs.

* Centrality Measures
1. Explore different centrality measures to identify the most influential nodes in the network.

* Scale-Free Networks
1. Delve into the concept of scale-free networks and their characteristics.
2. Conduct an analysis to demonstrate Facebook network graph is scale-free Graph or not.
3. proof it using "rich are getting richer phenomena"
